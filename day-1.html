  <h1>Templates</h1>

  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">Read more about
      templates here.</a>
  </p>

  <p>We know about variables. We know about Strings. We will now learn about But how to we put them together?</p>
  <p> We use backticks and ${ }. Have a look at an example</p>

  <h2>Example 1</h2>
  <p>Lets look at some variables and write them out in a string.</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let playerName;
      playerName = "John";
      document.write(`Hi, ${playerName}. Welcome to the game!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let dinnerItem;
      dinnerItem = "Lasagna";
      document.write(`We are having ${dinnerItem}, tonight!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let fruit;
      fruit = "strawberry";
      document.write(`It's ${fruit} season.`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Example 2</h2>
  <p>You can have as many variables as you want. You can even use numbers!</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let a;
      let b;
      let c;

      a = 12;
      b = 3;
      c = a + b;
      document.write(`${a} plus ${b} is equal to ${c}.`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      c = a * b;
      document.write(`${a} times ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      a = 512;
      b = 64;
      c = a / b;
      document.write(`${a} divided by ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Try it!</h2>
  <p>Now you try it!</p>
  <p>Make at least 5 more examples of templates yourself.</p>

  <p> 1.
    <script>
    let nickname;
    let playersgroup;
    nickname = "BunniiCat";
    playersgroup = "8";
    document.write(`Hey ${nickname} you're in this group with ${playersgroup} other players!`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>2.
    <script>
      let food1;
      let food2;
      let food3;
      let readytimer;
      food1 = "chicken";
      food2 = "mashed potatoes";
      food3 = "string beans";
      readytimer = "25min";
      document.write(`You're order of ${food1}, 
      ${food2}, and ${food3},<br> will be ready in ${readytimer}. Be sure to arrive early so you grab it when its hot.`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>3.
    <script>
      let e;
      let f;
      let g;
      e = "2";
      f = "4";
      g = "6";
      document.write(`There were ${e} ponies at the birthday party but there were<br> ${f+g}?? children at the party. Clearly they all couldn't all<br> ride at the same time so ${e*f} had to wait.`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>4.
    <script>
      let z;
      let x;
      let y;
      z = "10";
      x = "4";
      y = "6";
      document.write(`The sum of the exuation ${x} + ${y} is ${z}`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>5.
    <script>
      let p;
      let t;
      let d;
      let h;
      p ="13";
      d = "diamonds";
      h = "hearts";
      t = "trump"
      document.write(`In a game of spades ${p} cards are dealt where each play have to throw<br> same suit(for example: ${d} or ${h}) but if there's no other option,<br> a spade which is a ${t} suit can be played & win the round.`)
    </script>
